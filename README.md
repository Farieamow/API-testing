# API Testing Individual Project - README

## Introduction:

Welcome to the README file for the API testing individual project. This project aims to provide comprehensive testing for the API documented in the provided link: 
[API Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyzPMbEu6eEMFrvp-WHiJW-SvDTJvikqx1QGyyFgRXw/edit).

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to thoroughly test the functionality, reliability, and security aspects of the provided API. Through systematic testing, we aim to identify any potential issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities in the API implementation.

## Testing Approach:

### Functional Testing:
Verify that each endpoint documented in the API documentation functions as expected.
Test various inputs and scenarios to ensure proper handling of edge cases.
Validate the response data against expected results.

### Integration Testing:
Test the interaction between different API endpoints to ensure seamless integration.
Verify data consistency and integrity across endpoints.

### Performance Testing:
Evaluate the API's performance under different load conditions.
Measure response times and throughput to identify potential bottlenecks.

### Documentation Review:
Review the provided API documentation for accuracy and completeness.
Ensure that the documentation aligns with the actual API implementation.

## Tools and Technologies:

Testing Framework: We will utilize a suitable testing framework for API testing. Popular choices include Postman or custom Java scripts using libraries like requests.
Performance Testing Tools: Tools such as Apache JMeter or Gatling will be employed for performance testing.
Project Structure:

The project structure will include directories for test scripts, test data, performance test configurations, and any additional documentation.

/tests: Contains individual test scripts for each endpoint.
/performance_tests: Includes configurations and scripts for performance testing.
/docs: Any additional documentation or reports generated during testing.
Getting Started:

To begin testing the API, follow these steps:

Review the API documentation provided in the link.
Set up the testing environment by installing the necessary tools and libraries.
Clone the project repository and navigate to the appropriate directories.
Execute the test scripts according to the testing approach outlined above.
Monitor and analyze the test results.
Report any issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered during testing.
